		<h2> Research </h2>
		<article>
		  <p> This is an informal place for me to list my research
		  projects. It is not meant to be complete or even
		  informative. Poke around and contact me with any
		    questions.
		    </p>
		  <p>
		  Broadly speaking I'm interested in developing and
		  applying quantitative techniques to manage marine
		  resources efficiently and sustainably.  Below is a
		  collection of research projects I’ve been involved in,
		  with newer projects at the top. This is an evolving list
		  so check back later for more.

		  <header id="gradmcmc">
		    <h2>Bayesian algorithms for fisheries models.</h2>
		    <p>Testing the efficiency of gradient-based MCMC
		    algorithms</p>
		  </header>
		  <p>
		    Bayesian techniques have many advantages in fisheries
		    science, but many models can often be prohibitively
		    slow. However, a class of algorithms, called
		    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, has been gaining traction in
		    the statistical community, and has high potential to
		    substantial reduce run times. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    These gradient-based MCMC algorithms are not widely
		    used in the fisheries community, likely for several
		    reasons. First, the software typically used for
		    modeling (ADMB and TMB) do not have these algorithms
		    available (at least in a usable form). Second, they are
		    more difficult to understand and tune than traditional
		    samplers (although new versions are
		    self-tuning). Consequently, most fisheries analysts
		    resort to avoiding Hamiltonian algorithms, or using
		    them with default, suboptimal performance. Therefore
		    research is needed to test the utility, and demonstrate
		    the implementation of Hamiltonian algorithms in order
		    to advance their inclusion in the toolbox of
		    quantitative fisheries scientists.

		    I have worked to add beta versions of these algorithms
		    to TMB, and have been comparing their performance
		    against JAGS. You can see the
		    code <a href="https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/blob/master/TMB/R/mcmc.R">
		    here</a> and I encourage you to try them out and let me
		    know how it works.

		  </p>
		  <p> I gave a seminar on these methods where I tried to
		  explain them as best I could. Have a look if you're
		  curious: <a href="files/Monnahan_quantsem_2015.pptx">PPT slides</a>.

		  <header id="halibut">
		    <h2>Standardizing commercial catch rates for Pacific halibut.</h2>
		    <p>The effect of hook spacing on catch rates</p>
		  </header>
		  <p>
		    The International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) is
		    responsible for managing halibut in the North
		    Pacific. While they have reliable fishery independent
		    data, the IPHC also uses commercial logbook data to
		    develop a catch per unit effort (CPUE) index for use in
		    their stock assessment. There are two steps in creating
		    an index: (1) determine a reliable unit of effort, and
		    (2) standardizing the data with statistical techniques
		    used to remove factors influencing CPUE trends other
		    than changes in abundance.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  The nominal unit of effort for halibut long line gear is
		  a hook, but the efficiency of hooks varies as a function
		  of how close they are. To address this, I am working with
		  IPHC staff to reanalyze data collected in an experiment
		  from the 1970s to establish an “effective hook”
		  relationship. This relationship can also be elucidated
		  from the raw catch data themselves and used to
		  corroborate the results from the empirical analysis. This
		  new effective hook definition leads directly into the
		  second step, standardizing the catch data.

		    <h2>Simulation testing of fisheries stock assessments</h2>
		    <p>An R package that facilitates reproducible,
		      flexible, and rapid end-to-end simulation testing
		      with stock synthesis </p>
		  </header>
		  <p>
		    Fisheries stock assessment models (used to management
		    fisheries in the US and around the world) are complex
		    and often unpredictable. One approach to help
		    understand their statistical behavior is to use
		    simulation testing. With this in mind a group of
		    students and postdocs, based mainly at the UW,
		    developed a software platform called ss3sim
		    (<a href="https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim">code</a>
		    and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092725">paper</a>)
		    which facilitates this type of simulation testing. So
		    far we have used our package in 5 studies:
		    <ol, type="1">
		      <li> The effect of length bin width. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783615301259"> Read more </a> </li>

		    <h2>California blue whale assessment.</h2>
		    <p>Do fatal ship strikes threaten the recovery of this
		    endangered population?</p>
		  </header>
		  <p>
		   Many populations of whales were hunted to near
		   extinction, and some have shown signs of recovery while
		   others remain critically endangered. The blue whales off
		   California were no exception, and the lack of evidence
		   for an increase in their population size left many
		   concerned about ship strikes. The goal of my M.S. thesis
		   was to investigate the past, present, and future population trends
		   of this population, and try to quantify the risk of ship
		   strikes.
		  </p>
		<p>
		  The first step (and my first thesis chapter) was to
		   estimate how many whales of this population were caught
		   by whalers, separating those out from other blue whale
		   populations in the North Pacific. I did this by looking
		   at the spatial patterns in acoustic calls, which are
		   unique by population. The resulting estimates of catches
		   from that chapter fed directly into my second chapter,
		   which was to estimate their past, current and future
		   status, as well as the impact of potential threats
		   (e.g. ship strikes) moving forward. We found that the
		   whales had likely already recovered, and the lack of
		   increase was due to environmental limitations. This
		   positive story went viral in the
		   news <a href="http://wiley.altmetric.com/details/2658240/news">(see
		   here)</a>, although some scientists remain skeptical
		   (which is good for science!).
		</p>
		<p>
		  Trevor and I have applied for more funding to continue
		  studying blue whales in the North Pacific, so perhaps
		  there will be more on that later...<br>

		    <h2>Random side projects</h2>
		    <p>Some fun, non-dissertation distractions...</p>
		</header>
		<p> I utilize the open source software ADMB a lot for
		research. For part of my research I needed to have a better
		understanding of how it works internally, so I dug through
		the source code to figure it out. As a way to give back I
		wrote up some informal documentation for other users that
		hopefully will be useful. Check out some details
		about <a href="http://www.admb-project.org/examples/admb-tricks/covariance-calculations/">covariance calculations</a>
		and <a href="http://www.admb-project.org/developers/mcmc/mcmc-guide-for-admb/view">an
		MCMC guide</a>. 
		  <p>
		   I spent some time practicing my visualization skills by
		   making an animation of the history of whaling. Check it
		   out <a href="files/global_animation.gif">here</a>.
		  </p>
		<p>
		  I worked with some fellow QERM students to put together a
		  <a href="http://nkullman.github.io/QERMCollaborations">network
		  visualization</a> of our program. It's still in beta but
		  looks pretty cool so far.
		  </p>
		<p>
		My friend <a href="http://seananderson.ca">Sean</a> and I
		  did some work for Dr. Ray Hilborn making some maps of the
		  RAM and FAO data. Check them
		  out as they scroll by in the background <a href="http://ramlegacy.org">here</a>
